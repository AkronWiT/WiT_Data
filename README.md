Repository for data on women in tech

Look through reports and websites. 

Find statistics on women in tech, women in leadership, or the tech industry and put the data into CSV format. 

If you write code to clean up or acquire the data include that. 

Include a text document explaining your data. Include the following:
1. Why you think the data is useful, 
2. A link to the source (website, book, magazine article, etc) that you got it from 3. The date you acquired the data 
4. The date published. 
5. Any description of the data, for instance: "This data is from a website explaining statistics from a survey of a population of 50 women regarding their career experience." or "This is internal data from Company X and their investigation on the pay gap between women and men with similar job responsibilities." 

Create a folder with your name on it so there are no merge issues. 
If so inclined, do a visualization on the data.

We will be using this data for future data analysis, cleansing, and machine learning projects.
