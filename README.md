Repository for data on women in tech


Look through reports and websites. 
Find statistics on Women in Tech or Women in Leadership and put the data into CSV format. 
If you write code to clean up or acquire the data include that. 
Include a document on why you think the data is useful, the link to the source (website, book, magazine article, etc) that you got it from, the date you acquired the data, and the date published. 
Create a folder with your name on it so there are no merge issues. 
If so inclined, do a visualization on the data

We will be using this data for future data analysis, cleansing, and machine learning projects.
